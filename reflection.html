<p align="center"> <font face="Helvetica" color="White" size="5"> I learned a lot in this quarter of ICT. I was able to code things that I never
thought I would be able to. I started to understand <br> the process of coding more, and I understood how fun this can be if you practice and try new
things. I now see that <br> coding is a fun and useful skill to learn, and I'm grateful to be taught it everyday. I'll continue to practice <br> and
work hard on activities to further improve my skills. <br> <br> I definitely think I should've started my E-Portfolio earlier, so that I could've made the designs better, and make the overall quality of
<br> the website better. If I had started earlier, I would for sure be more satisfied with my work than I currently am. I hope that <br> In future situations,
I will be wise enough to learn from this and start long projects like this earlier. <br> <br> I am thankful for the subject of ICT as a whole, and I am also thankful
for Mrs. Uminga for being a kind, patient, loving, and supporting teacher. <br> In my opinion, ICT is one of the most important subjects that is being taught at
our school, especially during our time now where <br> technology is everywhere, and some of the highest-paying jobs in the world are those concerned with technology. <br> <br>
I will aim to do better in everything, not just ICT-Related, but in all subjects. The 1st Quarter should be a stepping stone to a path <br> that continues to
ascend.
